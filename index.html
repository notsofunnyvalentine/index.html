    <p><em>This is what happens when a chronically-ill girl with too much empathy, too much time and too many PubMed tabs open picks up a glitter pen.</em></p>

    <p>‚ô° diary fragment from a sick girl who knows too much ‚ô°</p>

    <p>i'm not here to sell you a cure.<br />
    i'm here because i've been poked, cut. scanned, stitched, dismissed, and glamorised.<br />
    because i've cried about my skin and my soul.<br />
    because sometimes all i can do is paint my face and google a clinical trial.</p>

    <p>‚ù• science - the real stuff, not vibes disguised as data<br />
    ‚ù• beauty - yes, actual beauty - the kind people try to shame us for<br />
    ‚ù• illness - the kind that lives in the body and the kind that seeps into a mirror.</p>

    <p>‚ô• i believe your desire to be beautiful is not shallow<br />
    ‚ô• i believe your confusion, your fatigue, your spirals - are data points, not failures.<br />
    ‚ô• i believe in letting people have options. real ones. even weird ones. especially weird ones.</p>

    <p>here we talk about how health, appearance, psychology and society touch each other like bruises and blush.<br />
    how pigment isn't just vanity, it's ritual.<br />
    how information isn't just power - it's kindness.</p>

    <p>this isn't self-help.<br />
    it's self-science.<br />
    self-softness.<br />
    self-defense.</p>

    <p>welcome to the lab-slash-lavender-padded-room. i invite you to stay. i poured acid into your tea anyways.</p>

    <p><em>With love&amp;care<br />
