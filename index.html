<!-- ‚ô° Diary Fragment by Valentina ‚ô° -->
<div class="manifesto-box">
  <h2>‚úß diary fragment from a sick girl who knows too much ‚úß</h2>
  <p class="italic">This is what happens when a chronically-ill girl with too much empathy, too much time and too many PubMed tabs open picks up a glitter pen.</p>
  
  <p>i'm not here to sell you a cure.<br>
  i'm here because i've been poked, cut. scanned, stitched, dismissed, and glamorised.<br>
  because i've cried about my skin and my soul.<br>
  because sometimes all i can do is paint my face and google a clinical trial.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>‚ù• science - the real stuff, not vibes disguised as data</li>
    <li>‚ù• beauty - yes, actual beauty - the kind people try to shame us for</li>
    <li>‚ù• illness - the kind that lives in the body and the kind that seeps into a mirror.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="hearts">
    <li>‚ô• i believe your desire to be beautiful is not shallow</li>
    <li>‚ô• i believe your confusion, your fatigue, your spirals ‚Äì are data points, not failures.</li>
    <li>‚ô• i believe in letting people have options. real ones. even weird ones. especially weird ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>here we talk about how health, appearance, psychology and society touch each other like bruises and blush.<br>
  how pigment isn't just vanity, it's ritual.<br>
  how information isn't just power ‚Äì it's kindness.</p>

  <p class="bold">this isn't self-help.<br>
  it's self-science.<br>
  self-softness.<br>
  self-defense.</p>

  <p class="italic">welcome to the lab-slash-lavender-padded-room. i invite you to stay. i poured acid into your tea anyways.</p>

  <p class="signature">With love & care,<br>Valentina ü§ç</p>
